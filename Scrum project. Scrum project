Create a Scrum Project in Jira. 
 • Add a backlog with at least 5 items (e.g., "Create user registration page", "Develop API for login"). 
 • Prioritize the backlog and create a 1-week sprint. 
 • Move backlog items into the sprint and start the sprint. 
 • Finally show the Screenshot of the sprint board at the start and end of the sprint.
